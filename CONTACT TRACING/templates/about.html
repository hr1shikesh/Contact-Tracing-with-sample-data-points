        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our Contact Tracing App. Our application is designed to assist educational institutions in managing and tracking potential COVID-19 infections among students.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions face unprecedented challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of students, faculty, and staff. Traditional methods of contact tracing and outbreak management are often inadequate in the face of rapidly evolving situations.</p>
        <p>Our Contact Tracing App leverages cutting-edge technology to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring student movements, identifying potential exposure, and taking timely actions to mitigate risks. By integrating location tracking, data analytics, and visualization tools, our app empowers administrators to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions.</p>
        <p>With our Contact Tracing App, educational institutions can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track the movements of infected individuals within campus premises in real-time.</li>
            <li>Identify and notify individuals who may have come into close contact with infected students.</li>
            <li>Generate detailed reports and visualizations to understand patterns of transmission and inform decision-making.</li>
            <li>Implement targeted interventions such as quarantine measures and testing protocols to contain outbreaks effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are committed to providing a reliable and effective tool to support educational institutions in safeguarding the health and well-being of their students and staff. Together, we can overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic and create a safer learning environment for all.</p>
